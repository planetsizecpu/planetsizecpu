### Ah, so you found me! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jose-Luis Delicado

I'm coding since 1986 but I still enjoy giving birth and sharing new ideas.

Last years I'm working as sysadm, but found time to play [Red-Lang](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html)
no other language gave me the easyness and freedom to take ouf of my mind the thoughts boiling inside.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Red-Lang if you are interested.
