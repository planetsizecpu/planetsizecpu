### Ah, so you found me! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jose-Luis Delicado

I'm coding since 1986 but I still enjoy giving birth to new ideas.

Now learning [Red-Lang](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html),
no other language gave me the easyness and freedom to take out of my mind the thoughts boiling inside (pressure matters ðŸ˜†).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Red-Lang if you are interested.
